Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given. You can contribute in many ways: Types of Contributions \u00b6 Report Bugs \u00b6 Report bugs at https://github.com/hainesm6/standard-linearity/issues. If you are reporting a bug, please include: Your operating system name and version. Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting. Detailed steps to reproduce the bug. Fix Bugs \u00b6 Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with \"bug\" and \"help wanted\" is open to whoever wants to implement it. Implement Features \u00b6 Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with \"enhancement\" and \"help wanted\" is open to whoever wants to implement it. Write Documentation \u00b6 Standard Linearity could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official Standard Linearity docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such. Submit Feedback \u00b6 The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/hainesm6/standard-linearity/issues. If you are proposing a feature: Explain in detail how it would work. Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement. Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :) Get Started! \u00b6 Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up standard-linearity for local development. Fork the standard-linearity repo on GitHub. Clone your fork locally $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/standard-linearity.git Ensure poetry is installed. Install dependencies and start your virtualenv: $ poetry install -E test -E doc -E dev Create a branch for local development: $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature Now you can make your changes locally. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests, including testing other Python versions, with tox: $ poetry run tox Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub: $ git add . $ git commit -m \"Your detailed description of your changes.\" $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature Submit a pull request through the GitHub website. Pull Request Guidelines \u00b6 Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines: The pull request should include tests. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and describe how to use the feature in the usage.md file. The pull request should work for Python 3.8 and 3.9. Check https://github.com/hainesm6/standard-linearity/actions and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions. Tips \u00b6 $ poetry run pytest tests/test_standard_linearity.py To run a subset of tests. Deploying \u00b6 New versions are deployed via GitHub Actions : A push to the master branch will trigger a release on TestPyPI . Publishing a new release on GitHub will trigger a release on PyPI . When making a release please note the following: notwells follows semantic versioning . To document new releases please enable auto-generate release notes when creating a release.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
