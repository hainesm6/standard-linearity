## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `standard-linearity` for local development.

1. Fork the `standard-linearity` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally

    ```shell
    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/standard-linearity.git
    ```

3. Ensure [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) is installed.
4. Install dependencies and start your virtualenv:

    ```shell
    $ poetry install -E test -E doc -E dev
    ```

5. Create a branch for local development:

    ```shell
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

6. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the
   tests, including testing other Python versions, with tox:

    ```shell
    $ poetry run tox
    ```

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and describe how to use the
   feature in the [usage.md](/docs/usage.md) file.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.8 and 3.9. Check
   https://github.com/hainesm6/standard-linearity/actions
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

## Tips

```shell
$ poetry run pytest tests/test_standard_linearity.py
```

To run a subset of tests.

## Deploying

New versions are deployed via [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions):

* A push to the master branch will trigger a release on [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/standard-linearity/).
* Publishing a new release on GitHub will trigger a release on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/standard-linearity/).
When making a release please note the following:
  * notwells follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
  * To document new releases please enable [auto-generate release notes](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes) when creating a release.
